# ToDoListUsingPlayFramework
Creating a ToDo List using the the Play Framework in Scala for final project in CS 330 at Simmons University.

The Play Framework (https://www.playframework.com/getting-started) sets up port 9000 as a local host. I had to learn and apply HTML, CSS, Scala and the sbt and PlayFramework features in Terminal and Visual Studio Code.

Shows the creation of the application and the sucessful running on the web page.  

First, I created controllers.TaskList1 under controllers. I updated routes to show the change. Clicking refresh on localhost:9000 I saw I made an error.

 After correcting it, I had hard coded a list of taks. However, this was not what I was wanting.

 I created a for loop in the taskList1 under views.
